########## INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this GeodeZYX toolbox is to provide all the functions which
can be useful for Geodesy and Geophysics. 

It includes low level functions, file management functions,
time and space-coordinates conversion functions, 
data (especially GNSS observations and orbits) retrieve functions, 
plots and visual selection functions ...

It is designed for Python 3 on a LINUX Ubuntu-like system.
Also tested with Anaconda


########## INSTALLATION

###### Prerequisite

We suppose that the regular Python libraires (matplotlib, numpy, scipy ...)
are already installed and up-to-date.

You have to install some annex Python libraries which are not installed per default
(tested with Anaconda and Ubuntu). Namely :

tabulate
collections
natsort
sympy

#### With the standard Python Interpreter of Ubuntu (most cases)

* In a terminal use pip to install the libraries :
sudo pip3 -I -U install <name of the library above>

#### With Anaconda

* update Anaconda first
conda update --all

* Install the package in Anaconda
conda install <name of the library above>


###### Main installation

Since the toolbox is still at the beta level, there is no “pythonic” installation way yet. Here are the two options you have to install the toolbox 

#### General installation (recommended)

* In a terminal, edit your .bashrc using e.g. 
nano ~/.bashrc

* add a line 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path to the toolbox>/geodezyx_toolbox_py3/lib

* The toolbox is installed !

#### Spyder user

For the ones who use the Graphical User Interface Spyder (which I recommend) :
* click on the “PYTHONPATH manager” button (the Python logo-shaped icon between the spanner icon and the left arrow icon on the main toolbar)
*  add the folder
<path to the toolbox>/geodezyx_toolbox_py3/lib

* The toolbox is installed !

#### check the installation

* in a python terminal run 
import geodetik as geok

If no error appears, then the toolbox is well installed !
Else, it may miss a library. Follow the *prerequisite* section

######## COMPONENTS

#### Main libraires
* genefun  : "low level" files and python objects manipulation

* geodetik : "low level" geodetic functions (time and space coordinates conversion ...)
  Now, (190406) geodetik is splited in several sub-modules :
  
    * conversion_coords : Coordinates conversion, ITRF@epoch determination, Helmert transformation
    * conversion_time : Time conversion
    * geok_euler_pole_calc : functions for Euler pole and plate velocity determination/substraction
    * geok_least_squares : functions for least squares inversion
    * geok_quaternions : functions for least squares inversion
    * geok_statistics  : functions for general basic statistics : RMS, running mean, 
                         smoothing, linear regression and detrend, outlier detection

    
* geoclass : "high level" geodetic functions (plots, data cleaning ...)


#### Other libraires
(To be continued ...)
geo_files_converter_lib
gins_runner
softs_runner
transformation

######## GET STARTED

import the modules of the toolbox in your/script function using :

import genefun as gf
import geodetik as geok
import 
 as gcls

and start to work, based on a script in the 'script' folder
